## Insurance Risk & Claims Analysis – Power BI Dashboard Project
# Project Overview
The Insurance Risk & Claims Analysis project was developed to help an insurance company centralize and analyze its policy holder and claims data for better strategic decision-making. Previously, policy and claims information was scattered across multiple sources, making it difficult for stakeholders to monitor performance, detect trends, and identify potential risk areas.
This project delivers an interactive Power BI dashboard that consolidates data into a single analytical view, enabling business users to track key metrics, explore customer segments, and uncover claim patterns efficiently.
